        <dt>The Lists Element</dt>
        <dd>There are three types of lists, "Unordered List ("< ul >< /ul >")," "Ordered List ("< ol >< /ol >")," and "Description List ("< dl >< /dl >", "< dt >< /dt>", "< dd >< /dd >")." These are used based on the type of information being listed. Each list contains items of content listed inside the list.</dd>
