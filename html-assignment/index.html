            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p1>I am an international student from Japan. I learned calligraphy for six years, and I have a teacher licence for the children. When I was in junior high school, I was a leader of Home Economics Club, and I made several clothes for the culture festival every year. I also love reading books, my favourite books are Harry Potter series since my friends recommeded those for me.</p1>
                <p2>When I was in <sup>2nd</sup> grade in senior high school, I have come to study in Red Deer, in Alberta for ten months. I lived in my excellent host family's house, and met a lot of wonderful people. From this experience, my dream is to get permanent residency to live in Canada in the future.</p2>
                <p3>Here is my favourite quote from the anime I am currentry into. 
                    <em><blockquote>Talent is something you make bloom, instinct is something you. <cite>Tooru Oikawa from <q>Haikyuu!!</q></cite></blockquote></em>
