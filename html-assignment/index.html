            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an international student from Japan. I learned calligraphy for six years, and I have a teacher licence for the children. When I was in junior high school, I was a leader of the Home Economics Club, and I made several clothes for the cultural festival every year. My favourite books are the Harry Potter series, since my friends recommended them to me.</p>
                    <p>When I was in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade in senior high school, I came to study in Red Deer, Alberta for ten months. I lived in my excellent host family's house, and met a lot of wonderful people. From this experience, my dream is to get permanent residency to live in Canada in the future.</p>
                        <p3>Here is my favourite quote from the anime I am currently into; 
                            <em><blockquote>Talent is something you make bloom, instinct is something you polish. -<cite>Tooru Oikawa from <q>Haikyuu!!</q></cite></blockquote></em></p>
